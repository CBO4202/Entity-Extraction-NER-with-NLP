Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Welcome to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) project! This repository contains various resources and examples for performing NER using different NLP libraries and approaches. The project includes a comprehensive PDF guide, Python code samples, and specific implementations using Hugging Face Transformers and PDF files.
Project Structure
Entity Extraction (NER) with Natural Language Processing (NLP).pdf A detailed PDF document explaining Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLP, including techniques, importance, and applications.
Entity extraction with NER.ipynb/: A directory containing Python code samples for performing NER using various NLP libraries.
Python code sample for NER using spaCy.
Python code sample for NER using NLTK.
Python code sample for NER using Gensim (Note: Gensim is not typically used for NER directly, so this will include topic modeling as a related task).
Python code sample for NER using Stanford NLP.
Python code sample for NER using Flair.
HuggingFace NER sample.ipynb A Python file demonstrating entity extraction using Hugging Face Transformers.
Resume NER Extraction.ipynb: A Python file for performing NER on PDF files.
